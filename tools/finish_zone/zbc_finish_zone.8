.SH NAME
zbc_finish_zone \- Finish zones of a ZBC or ZAC device

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B zbc_finish_zone
[options]
.IR device " [" zone "]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B zbc_finish_zone
is used to finish (transition to full state) zones of a ZBC or ZAC device.

.PP
The
.I device
argument must be the pathname to the target device block device file (e.g.,
.IR /dev/sdb "),"
or to the target device SG node file (e.g.,
.IR /dev/sg3 ")."
On old kernels lacking ZBC and ZAC support, only the device SG node file will
be available.

.PP
The
.I zone
argument specifies the zone to be finished. This argument is ignored if the
\fB-all\fP option is used. By default, the zone argument specifies a zone
number, starting from 0 for the first zone of the device. If the option
\fB-lba\fP is specified, the zone argument is interpreted as the start LBA of
the zone to finish. If the option \fB-sector\fP is specified, then the zone
argument is interpreted as the start sector (512B unit) of the zone to finish.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options can be specified.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display a usage help message and exit.
.TP
.BR \-v

to finish.
